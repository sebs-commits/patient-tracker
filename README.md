# Hospital Patient Tracking System

This is a personal project inspired by my work as a patient transporter at a local hospital. It's a web application designed for hospital or healthcare organizations, focusing on replicating the workflow
of patient transportation. Admin users can submit patient transport requests, which are then assigned to available transporters for completion.

## Overview

This project was inspired by my passion for healthcare and my role as a patient transporter at a local hospital. The project is a web application designed to support 
hospital and healthcare-related organizations by simulating the workflow of patient transportation.The application replicates the typical operations that a patient transporter would handle. For instance,
an admin or super user can submit a transport request for a patient who needs to attend an appointment. This request is then sent to the available patient transporters for completion. On the transporter's
end, they can view the requests, accept them, and mark them as complete once the task is finished. The goal of this project is to provide a seamless workflow for transporting patients, ensuring efficiency 
in hospital settings. As the project evolves, additional features will be added to further improve the operational processes within healthcare facilities.
